# Fast Refresh Loop - FIXED

## Problem
`/pferde-ratgeber` overview page had **infinite Fast Refresh reload loops** during development.

## Root Cause
**Header component was recreating the navigation array on every render.**

The `navigationItems` array in `components/Header.tsx` was being recreated inside the component function, causing React to detect changes and trigger continuous reload cycles.

## Solution Applied
Commit: `37cf246`

**Moved navigation array outside the component:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (BAD)
export default function HeaderUnified() {
  const navigationItems = [
    { label: "Ratgeber", ... },
    { label: "Über uns", ... },
  ]
  // ... rest of component
}

// AFTER (GOOD)
const NAVIGATION_ITEMS = [
  { label: "Ratgeber", ... },
  { label: "Über uns", ... },
]

export default function HeaderUnified() {
  // Uses stable NAVIGATION_ITEMS constant
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript type-check passes
- ✅ ESLint passes
- ✅ All navigation functionality preserved
- ✅ Mobile menu works correctly

## How to Test
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/pferde-ratgeber`
3. Should load without endless Fast Refresh loops
4. Edit a file → should trigger normal hot-reload (not full page reload)

## Why This Happened
The same anti-pattern had been applied to Header, but other pages had already been fixed (see commits 9cd340b and 5a56b18). Since Header is used on every page, it eventually caused issues visible on actively-developed pages.

## Prevention
- Always define arrays/objects OUTSIDE component functions
- Use linting to catch this pattern
- Review shared components (Header, Footer, Layout) when debugging page-level issues

**Status**: Fixed and committed. Ready to test in development.
