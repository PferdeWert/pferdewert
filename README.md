# PferdeWert

This repository contains the PferdeWert project.

The frontend is a Next.js application located in `frontend/`.
All npm commands such as `npm install` and `npm run dev` must be
run from that directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend lives in `backend/` and uses FastAPI. See
`backend/requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
