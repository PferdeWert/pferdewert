Focus on content structure FIRST.

Before writing anything:

- Build a topical map of your industry

- Create pillar pages for main themes

- Plan supporting cluster content

- Map internal linking strategy

This foundation beats random "SEO content" every time.

Fix technical foundations.

90% of sites have basic issues killing their rankings:

- Slow loading speeds

- Poor mobile experience

- Broken internal links

- Missing schema markup

- Duplicated content problems

Hire a pro like @briandecoded to get these issues solved and fix these before chasing backlinks.

@briandecoded Build topical authority systematically.

Don't chase individual keywords. Dominate entire topics.

Cover every question your ideal customer might search for.

Become THE resource in your space.

Authority sites eventually rank for everything.

@briandecoded Optimize for conversions, not just traffic.

I once ranked #1 for a keyword bringing 1MM monthly visitors.

Conversions: 14 signups.

Traffic without intent is vanity.

Target keywords that actually convert to revenue.
