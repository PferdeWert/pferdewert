## Best Practices

### Agent Selection Strategy
1. **Start with the most specialized agent** for the primary task
2. **Use code-reviewer as final validation** before commits
3. **Combine agents for complex tasks** (e.g., frontend-dev + business-analyst for conversion optimization)
4. **Leverage agent strengths** - don't use business-analyst for TypeScript issues

### Communication Tips
- **Be specific about context**: "This is for the horse evaluation form on mobile"
- **Provide error messages**: Include exact error text and stack traces
- **Share relevant code**: Paste the specific code sections being reviewed
- **Mention urgency**: "Critical payment issue affecting live users"

### Agent Limitations
- **No cross-agent communication**: Each agent works independently
- **Context window limits**: Keep requests focused and specific
- **No persistent memory**: Each interaction is stateless
- **Specialized knowledge only**: Don't use agents outside their expertise

## Integration with MCP Servers

All agents have access to:
- **Playwright MCP**: Visual validation and browser testing
- **MongoDB MCP**: Database operations and query optimization
- **Figma MCP**: Design system access (frontend-dev, business-analyst)
- **DataForSEO MCP**: SEO analytics and keyword research (business-analyst)
- **Filesystem MCP**: Code file access and analysis
- **Vercel MCP**: Deployment and production monitoring

## Monitoring Agent Effectiveness

Track these metrics to measure agent value:
- **Code Review Efficiency**: Time saved on manual review cycles
- **Bug Detection Rate**: Issues caught before production
- **Performance Improvements**: Core Web Vitals score improvements
- **Security Compliance**: DSGVO/PCI DSS violations prevented
- **Development Velocity**: Feature delivery speed increase

Remember: Agents are force multipliers, not replacements for good development practices!

### Pre-Commit Automation
- Husky pre-commit hook runs automatically:
  - lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier on staged files)
  - `npm --prefix frontend run type-check`
  - `npm --prefix frontend run test --if-present`
- Recommendation: Keep tests fast and headless; add a `test` script in `frontend/package.json` when tests exist.
