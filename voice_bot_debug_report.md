# Whisper Voice Bot Debug Report

## Problem Summary
The Whisper voice bot was experiencing immediate errors when processing voice messages. The bot would start but fail during voice transcription.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue: Missing FFmpeg Dependency**
- Whisper requires FFmpeg for audio processing
- FFmpeg was not installed on the system
- Error: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. FFmpeg Installation
- Downloaded static FFmpeg binary from johnvansickle.com
- Extracted to `/home/dev/pferdewert/ffmpeg`
- Modified voice_bot.py to add current directory to PATH

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging throughout voice processing pipeline
- Improved error messages with detailed stack traces
- Added startup checks for FFmpeg availability

### 3. Timeout Improvements
- Fixed infinity_polling timeout issues
- Added shorter timeouts for update clearing
- Improved connection handling

## Files Modified

### `/home/dev/pferdewert/voice_bot.py`
- Added logging configuration
- Added FFmpeg PATH setup
- Enhanced error handling in voice_to_text()
- Improved startup sequence with dependency checks
- Better timeout handling for Telegram polling

### New Files Created
- `/home/dev/pferdewert/test_voice_components.py` - Component testing script
- `/home/dev/pferdewert/test_voice_pipeline.py` - End-to-end pipeline test
- `/home/dev/pferdewert/ffmpeg` - Static FFmpeg binary

## Test Results

### Component Tests âœ…
- **FFmpeg**: Working correctly
- **Whisper**: Model loads and transcribes successfully
- **Telegram**: Bot connects and authenticates

### Pipeline Test âœ…
- Voice file processing: Working
- Transcription: Working
- Command processing: Working
- Response generation: Working

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED**: The voice bot is now running successfully and ready to process voice messages.

### Bot Status
- Process ID: 9042
- Status: Running and polling
- Telegram: Connected (@Pferdewert_bot)
- Whisper: Model loaded (base)
- FFmpeg: Available and working

## Commands Available
- `claude`, `code`, `entwicklung` â†’ Claude Code integration
- `notion`, `notiz`, `dokument` â†’ Notion integration  
- `status`, `zustand`, `server` â†’ System status
- `pferd`, `horse`, `bewertung` â†’ Horse evaluation

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual voice messages via Telegram
2. Monitor logs for any issues during real usage
3. Consider upgrading Whisper model if transcription quality needs improvement
4. Implement actual integrations for detected commands

## Files to Monitor
- Bot logs: Check stderr output from running process
- Error handling: Watch for any FFmpeg or Whisper issues
- Memory usage: Monitor for potential memory leaks during long operation
